Bug:
- function call containing expression doesn't work
    e.g. square(var+2)


TODO:
- Parser indentation recognition
    Keep track of indentation level through variable in parser
- Operators based on operand types
    Solution: check types before creating LLVM op in codegen
- Enable redefinition of variables
    Solution: create symbol table in parser to store expression values of variables
